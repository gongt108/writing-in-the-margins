So it\u2019s a relief when his skill on the basketball court earns him a scholarship to college, far away from his childhood home. He soon meets Julia Padavano, a spirited and ambitious young woman who surprises William with her appreciation of his quiet steadiness. With Julia comes her family; she is inseparable from her three younger sisters: Sylvie, the dreamer, is happiest with her nose in a book and imagines a future different from the expected path of wife and mother; Cecelia, the family\u2019s artist; and Emeline, who patiently takes care of all of them. Happily, the Padavanos fold Julia\u2019s new boyfriend into their loving, chaotic household./n/nBut then darkness from William\u2019s past surfaces, jeopardizing not only Julia\u2019s carefully orchestrated plans for their future, but the sisters\u2019 unshakeable loyalty to one another. The result is a catastrophic family rift that changes their lives for generations. Will the loyalty that once rooted them be strong enough to draw them back together when it matters most?/n/nVibrating with tenderness, /n/n is a gorgeous, profoundly moving portrait of what\u2019s possible when we choose to love someone not in spite of who they are, but because of it.", "genres": "Fiction, Historical Fiction, Audiobook, Contemporary, Literary Fiction", "page_num": "416 pages, Kindle Edition", "publication_date": "First published March 14, 2023", "book_id": "61771675-hello-beautiful"}
