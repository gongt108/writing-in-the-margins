It was her mother’s diagnosis of terminal cancer, when Michelle was twenty-five, that forced a reckoning with her identity and brought her to reclaim the gifts of taste, language, and history her mother had given her."], "genres": ["Nonfiction", "Memoir", "Audiobook", "Biography", "Food"], "page_num": "256 pages, Hardcover", "publication_date": "First published April 20, 2021", "book_id": "54814676-crying-in-h-mart"}
